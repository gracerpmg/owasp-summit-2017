> Virtually every company today uses firewalls to enforce perimeter security. However, this security model is problematic because, once that perimeter is breached, an attacker can access access a companyâ€™s privileged intranet relatively easily . As companies adopt mobile and cloud technologies, the perimeter is becoming increasingly difficult to enforce. Google is taking a different approach to network security. OWASP is removing the requirement for a privileged intranet and moving our corporate applications to the Internet.
